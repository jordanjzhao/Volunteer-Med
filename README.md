heyDoc! is an application that connects volunteer doctors to patients globally with an aim to provide better access.
This application connects doctors to patients virtually through patient cases and text messaging. Doctors can view patients' 
cases and aid them through text and video call services. Meanwhile, patients can seek help from doctors by posting a case for 
doctors to accept. We came up with this application due to the doctor shortages as well as high medical fees that may prevent 
patients from consulting with certified professionals. Especially in developing countries around the globe that have been facing 
a shortage of doctors. In the past, various global not-for-profits like Doctors without Borders & Projects Abroad have attempted 
to reduce the impact of this issue through their cross-country volunteering programs. However, with the emergence of the pandemic 
and ever-changing travel restrictions, fewer doctors have been able to contribute to these in-person programs than ever before.
By applying a virtual aspect to the concept, we can provide medical services more often and patients can receive the attention they need.
In return, the app could expand and look forward to expansion areas that include confidentiality and potentially an acceptance to document
patient information for research in exchange for the service. As a result, both patient and doctor can benefit from medical care and the growth
to medical research and issues of interest.
